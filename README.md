This project contains a ComfyUI workflow that leverages Hy3D (Hunyuan3D) to texture an existing 3D mesh using a single input image.

You need to have a correct Hunyuan3D install on Comfy UI and have
  - Hy3D DelightModel (hunyuan3d-delight-v2-0),
  - Hy3D PaintModel (hunyuan3d-paint-v2-0-turbo),
  - a upscale Model (e.g. 4x_foolhardy_Remacri.pth)
